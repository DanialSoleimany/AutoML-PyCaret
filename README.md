## 🧠 PyCaret Classification Project – Heart Disease Prediction

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline using **PyCaret**, a powerful and low-code machine learning library in Python. It is designed to simplify the process of building and deploying machine learning models with minimal coding effort.

The objective of this project is to build a classification model to predict the presence of heart disease based on various clinical and demographic features. By leveraging PyCaret, we automate the key steps of the machine learning lifecycle, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and saving the trained model for deployment.

### 🔍 What’s Covered

- **Automatic preprocessing** of data including missing value handling, encoding, feature scaling, etc.
- **Model training and selection** by comparing multiple algorithms in one step.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** to optimize model performance.
- **Visualization and evaluation** of the model using interactive plots.
- **Prediction on new data** to demonstrate how the final model can be used.
- **Model saving and loading**, making the model ready for production or further use.

### 📊 Why PyCaret?

PyCaret is ideal for both beginners and professionals. It dramatically reduces the amount of code needed to build powerful models and provides a consistent and easy-to-use interface for different machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, NLP, time series forecasting, and anomaly detection.

In this project, PyCaret’s **classification module** is used to work on a medical dataset and generate a model that can assist in predicting heart disease risk.

### 📚 Learning Goals

- Understand how to use PyCaret to automate an ML workflow.
- Learn how to quickly compare multiple models and select the best one.
- Get familiar with deploying and reusing ML models efficiently.
- Appreciate the power of low-code ML tools in practical projects.

### 📎 About the Dataset

The dataset used is a public heart disease dataset which includes information such as age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and other health-related features. The target variable indicates whether or not a patient is diagnosed with heart disease.
