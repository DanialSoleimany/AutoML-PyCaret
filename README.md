## 🧠 PyCaret Classification Project – Heart Disease Prediction

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline using **PyCaret**, a powerful low-code library in Python. It is designed to simplify the process of building and deploying machine learning models with minimal coding effort.

The objective of this project is to build a classification model to predict the presence of heart disease based on various clinical and demographic features. By leveraging PyCaret, we automate the key steps of the machine learning lifecycle, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and saving the trained model for deployment.

# 🔍 Introduction to PyCaret

**PyCaret** is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that aims to simplify and automate the end-to-end machine learning workflow.  
It enables data scientists, analysts, and even non-technical users to build, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models quickly and efficiently — all with minimal coding.

## ⚙️ What Makes PyCaret Special?

Unlike traditional libraries like `scikit-learn`, where you need to manually handle preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, PyCaret offers a **unified and automated pipeline** that can take your raw dataset and transform it into a production-ready model with just a few function calls.

## 🔧 Supported Functionalities

PyCaret is built in a **modular fashion**, with dedicated modules for various machine learning tasks:

- 📊 **Classification** – e.g., spam detection, churn prediction  
- 📈 **Regression** – e.g., house price prediction, sales forecasting  
- 🔍 **Clustering** – e.g., customer segmentation  
- 🧠 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification  
- ⏳ **Time Series Forecasting** – e.g., stock price forecasting  
- 🚨 **Anomaly Detection** – e.g., fraud detection, outlier analysis
